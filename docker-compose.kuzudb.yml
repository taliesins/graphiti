    ports:
      - "8080:8080" # Default K첫zuDB HTTP port, if ever needed. K첫zuDB primarily uses direct library access.
    volumes:
      - ./kuzu_data:/kuzu_data # Mount a local directory for data persistence
    environment:
      # K첫zuDB typically doesn't require extensive environment variables for basic setup
      # It's configured via client connection parameters (database path)
      # The volume mount above handles the database path persistence
      KUZU_DATABASE_PATH: /kuzu_data/graphiti_kuzudb
    # K첫zuDB doesn't have a built-in healthcheck via HTTP in the same way some other DBs do.
    # Client-side connection attempt is the typical healthcheck.
    # For compose, we can rely on the container starting.
    # command: # Optional: specify command if needed to change default behavior or db path
